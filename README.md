# datamaps.cc

The home of hundreds of SVG vector maps, generated using [Kartograph.py](https://github.com/kartograph/kartograph.py) from [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/) shapefiles.

**Caution:** At the moment, these maps are more or less a showcase of Kartograph bugs, so handle with care or wait until the first official release.
